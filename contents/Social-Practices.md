### Research on the Promotion Dilemma of "Ecological Burial" in Nanjing

- Directed an exploratory qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and participant observation to investigate the low adoption rate of eco-friendly burials in Nanjing.

-Identified that the primary resistance stems from deep-rooted cultural symbol conflicts rather than economic factors. The "minimalist" nature of eco-burials compresses the social functions of traditional funerals, leading to an institutional mismatch between policy incentives and the psychological need for "settling in the earth."

### Research and Documentary on "Cyber-Metaphysics" Youth Subculture

- Applied visual anthropology methods, conducting in-depth interviews with students from diverse academic backgrounds and directing the documentary "Seeking an Answer" to track metaphysical consumption on social media.

- Revealed that "Cyber-Metaphysics" serves as a "ritual resistance" and "emotional tool" for youth coping with modern anxieties. Highly educated groups achieve "rational re-enchantment" through intellectual reconstruction, seeking psychological autonomy within the cracks of instrumental rationality.

### Research on Gender Consciousness Formation and Disciplinary Gender Structures

- Utilized the life-course approach to conduct in-depth interviews on the awakening paths of women from diverse backgrounds and the survival strategies of female physics students in male-dominated environments.

- Analyzed how family, media, and workplace serve as "awakening scenes" that shape gender consciousness. Exposed how the "default-male" logic in physics leads to the marginalization of women in spatial and discursive dimensions, emphasizing that these dilemmas stem from structural environments rather than capability gaps.

### Research on Intergenerational Interaction and Community Identity in Qingdao Road

- Conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 elderly and 7 young residents in the Qingdao Road community under the "Xingzhi Mengxue" research initiative to compare intergenerational participation.

- Uncovered divergent participation logics: the elderly focus on "mutual aid," while the youth are driven by "interest-based social circles." Proposed differentiated incentive mechanisms to transform community perception from "instrumental cognition" to "homeland identity."
